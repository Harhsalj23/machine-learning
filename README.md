- In this github repo Machine learning algorithms have been applied on datasets.
-  The algorithms such as decision tree random forest,k nearest neighbor,linear regression,logistic regression,support vector machines are implemented.
* Along wiith these algorithms various methods of feature enginneering such as feature scaling,feature transformation have also been applied.
- The Air quality index prediction project indicates the accuracy of prediction of airquality index as various regression models are used.
- Since a nonlinearity is observevd in the dataset as the air quality index differs from place to place.
- In order to predict air quality index various parameters such as CO,,SO2,NH3,NO2 are taken into consideration.
- Predominant parameters such as PM2.5 and PM10 are major contributors to the prediction of AQI in many states.
- Reference for air quality taken from the book Air Quality 4th edition by Thad Godish.
